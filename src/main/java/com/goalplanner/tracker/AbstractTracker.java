 * leagues-profile goals are loaded into memory, so this tracker only
 * ever sees the goals relevant to the current world.

		// below-target value for a previously-complete goal therefore
		// almost always means the backing value hasn't synced yet (pre-
		// login window, profile switch, brief zero reads). Keeping COMPLETE
		// goals terminal prevents the original completedAt from being
		// clobbered by a transient zero read and subsequently overwritten
		// with System.currentTimeMillis() when the real value arrives.
		//
		// Manual un-completion is still supported via the user-facing
		// markGoalIncomplete path (CUSTOM goals only); for auto-tracked

		// state explicitly.
