/**
 * A single Command that wraps an ordered list of sub-commands so they
 * appear as one entry in undo/redo history.
 *
 * <p>Used by the create-and-position flow in GoalPanel where adding a goal
 * is followed by an immediate move/reposition: without compounding, the
 * user would see two stack entries and have to undo twice to actually
 * remove the goal (the first undo would silently revert the position).
 *
 * <p>Apply runs sub-commands in order; revert runs them in reverse order.
 * If any sub-command fails, the composite returns false but does NOT roll
 * back the partially-applied prefix — the {@link CommandHistory}
 * fail-open contract handles this by dropping the entry from history,
 * leaving the partial state in place.
