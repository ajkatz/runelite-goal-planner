/**
 * In-memory undo / redo stack for {@link Command} entries.
 *
 * <p>Standard semantics:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #execute(Command)} runs the command and pushes onto the
 *       undo stack. Any pending redo entries are cleared (forking history).
 *   <li>{@link #undo()} pops the most recent undo entry, calls
 *       {@code revert()}, and pushes onto the redo stack. If revert returns
 *       false the entry is dropped without being pushed onto redo.
 *   <li>{@link #redo()} pops the most recent redo entry, calls
 *       {@code apply()}, and pushes back onto the undo stack. If apply
 *       returns false the entry is dropped.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The undo stack is bounded — once it exceeds {@link #CAP} entries, the
 * oldest entries are dropped (the redo stack is implicitly bounded by what
 * the user has undone). Both stacks are session-only; they are never
 * persisted.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe — all calls must come from the EDT (or whichever
 * single thread owns the API impl).
